# 2D Rubik's Cube Game

## Description
This project is a simulation of a 2D variant of the Rubik's Cube game. The game consists of a grid where rows and columns can be cyclically rotated to align the colors in homogeneous rows and columns. The goal is to solve the puzzle by aligning all rows and columns to have the same color. The game features a graphical user interface implemented using Java Swing and is designed to support board sizes of `2x2`, `4x4`, and `6x6`.
